# EarMusicalTraining
A Java Desktop application to develop musical ear to recognize tones, based on the tonal gravity theory

This application was entirely made with Java Swing for personal purposes.

As a musician i always wanted to learn how to develop and train my musical skills and ear, but using the synesthesia and tonal gravity to better recognize the tonalities of the songs, or maybe the tone of the song that a musician is playing.

The application has two modes:

-Practice Mode: Just for practicing purposes.
-Exam Mode: This mode record all the exercises that you have worked on on a file, and the register could you use it to see all the improvement that you had using this program.

This application is totally free to use, just for educational purposes.

Just have fun learning! :)
